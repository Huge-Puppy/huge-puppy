Santiago Cards is an active and growing business I run designing and selling playing cards, mostly on Kickstarter. It started when I was perusing Kickstarter and noticed that there was a VERY active playing card community. I started designing to scratch my creative itch and to see if I could have as much success as others in the business. I made one deck and it funded successfully (thank goodness). Somebody reached out to me and taught me a lot about the playing card community - I owe him a lot.

I started making better decks and funded one (Cartes Moreau) for $28,000. With about $50,000 of total revenue, I had a net loss. So I learned to pay a lot more attention to accounting, costs, shipping, and the details of running a retail business. 

### Lessons Learned
- Pay attention to profit margin and peripheral costs!
- Do your accounting frequently!
- Be prompt and courteous in customer service!

My goal in 2023 is to earn $100,000 net revenue, and Santiago Cards is going to be a big part of that. I am currently (2023-2-15) working on a Leonardo Da Vinci-themed deck that I think will hit $50,000 on Kickstarter. Here's to many more decks ðŸ¥‚
