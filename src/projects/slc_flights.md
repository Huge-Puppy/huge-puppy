This is a project taking a widely popular product and superfocusing on a specific demographic: people who primarily use SLC international airport. I'll be notifying users of cheaper-than-usual flights, allow users to set travel dates then show them the best options, and I'd like to work in flight chaining - how sometimes it's cheaper to book multiple one way tickets than round trip.

### Guidelines
- I don't have to be a fish in a big pond. I can be in a small pond and execute well enough to capture my portion of the market.
- Marketing will be my #1 priority
- It's gonna be so sexy

This is my $10,000 MRR business. I'll need 2,400 people paying $50/year to hit my goal.
