Whatado aimed at connecting people who have a hard time meeting new friends or finding things to do. You would create an event for something you wanted to do or something you were planning, and other people could indicate that they wanted to come with you.

### Lessons Learned
- It's easier to verify there's a strong need for your product **before** you build it.
- Without good marketing your project is dead in the water. 
- Validate as you go. 

In the end, we built a great product that no one ever used. I learned a lot about websockets, nodejs, backend tech in general, and database management. And I only deleted all of our user data one time lol.
