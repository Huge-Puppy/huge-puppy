Topsecret Hunts started as a website, served with Django. It then became a react-native mobile application. This app allowed you to sign up for treasure hunts that I would organize and coordinate. I came up with a lot of clues, built treasure chests, and snuck around a lot of neighborhoods. I was starting to see success with events in my area (I had an event scheduled for $6,000 and others in the works). But then everyone stopped going outside and meeting up for some reason. 

### Lessons Learned
- PIVOT
- Don't give up easily on something that has a bit of traction. Be patient.
- Know your best market and marketing strategies.

There's still a soft spot in my heart for Topsecret Hunts... who knows maybe I'll use a revive one day.
