Pumped is an app where you can create vision boards as slide shows and set them to music. Custom alarms will remind you to view the slideshow at specific times during the day. The idea is that you watch the slide show right before your planned daily activities to create motivation. So many people lay in bed in the morning regret their decision to work out the previous night, but we choose our emotions. Pumped powers you up to choose the right emotions when you need them. This was a product that I really wanted, and I figured others would like it as well. 

### Lessons Learned
- Shipping quick is great.
- If you have specific tech/integrations in mind, make sure that what you're planning is possible.
- Whispering online will not build you an audience.

In the end, I built a really great product that only my sister and I use. Turns out that Spotify, who I was integrating with, decided that my app violated their terms of service. There are probably other music integrations I could look into, but it's reached maximum usefulness for me: exactly what I wanted.
