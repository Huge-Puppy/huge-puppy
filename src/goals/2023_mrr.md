Might be the most difficult goal on the list. I'll hit $100,000 just with playing cards, imo. But MRR requires me to build some sort of subscription service, most likely. Right now I'm thinking Rock climbing gym software. If I build an amazing product that is very easy to switch and learn from RGP, the $$$ will flow. The flight notifier for SLC is another promising option.
