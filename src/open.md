This is the open page. I need to connect some data sources to this site so it will build these graphs automagically.
Might need to turn goals into a collection to manage this more efficiently. 
TODO: find out if I can create js-like loops in md pages like in .njk pages

### Here are my goals:
- Make $100,000 this year
- Get to $10,000 MRR
